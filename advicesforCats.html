                <h4>Caring for a cat at home requires attention, love, and some specific knowledge. Here are some tips for taking good care of your cat: <span style="color: var(--text-color); font-size: 10px;"><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="advicesforDogs.html">Show Dog advices</a></span></h4>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>Food : Give him a balanced diet adapted to his age, weight, and specific needs (kitten, adult, senior). Make sure he always has fresh water available.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Hygiene : Clean his litter box regularly to avoid bad odors and infections. Brush him to avoid knots and reduce the amount of hair ingested when grooming him.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Health : Get your cat vaccinated and follow regular veterinary visits for health checks. Treat him against parasites (fleas, ticks, worms).</li>
                <br>
                <li>Mental and physical stimulation :  Play with him to stimulate his hunting instinct and avoid boredom.  Provide toys, cat trees, and scratching posts so your cat can exercise.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Safety : If your cat goes outside, make sure it is in a safe environment. Indoors, secure windows and balconies to prevent falls.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Comfort : Create comfortable spaces where your cat can rest and hide. Cats like to have quiet places to sleep.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Love and attention : Cats appreciate moments of tenderness, so spend time with them, pet them, and be attentive to their needs.</li>
